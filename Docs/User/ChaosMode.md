# Chaos Mode

---

Chaos Mode is a game mode which randomizes the positions of all cogs and bilbies and the levels that the portals in Rainbow Cliffs direct you to according to a list of set positions.

To activate Chaos Mode, the [host](./Host.md) must select the Chaos Mode game mode from the host menu (see [the lobby UI documentation](./LobbyUI.md)) or run the [gamemode command](./Commands/GameMode.md).

When you start the game as normal, you'll quickly find that the collectibles are not in their normal positions.
