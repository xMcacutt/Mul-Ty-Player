## Basic Information

#### Description

- clients

#### Usages
- /clist

## More Information
The clist command has two definitions, for the client definition see [CommandList](./CommandList.md).
This command, when run in the server, will list all of the currently connected clients and their ids. This is useful for server operators since by nature of it being a command line app, it is not possible to easily view the client ids otherwise.
