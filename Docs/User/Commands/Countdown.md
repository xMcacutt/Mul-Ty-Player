## More Information
The countdown command is used to bypass [the ready system](../Ready.md), allowing the host to automatically start, as well as forcefully end, the main countdown.
This command does not work in hide & seek mode, instead /hideseek abort should be used. For more information see [the hide and seek mode documentation](../HideSeek.md).
