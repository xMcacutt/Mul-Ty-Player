## More Information
The crash command is a host only command used to force close everyone's games. This is to aid in mitigating crashes during speedruns. Ty is known to have a memory leak which occurs after roughly 30 level reloads. This is a large enough number for a single full game run but multiple runs are likely to encounter the crash. It is advised that the game is reset before a speedrun. This command makes it easy for the host to ensure everyone is reset.
