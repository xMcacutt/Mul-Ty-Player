## More Information
The where command prints your current position to the console. 
It can also be used to print the position of another connected player.
Your position in game is determined by the absolute coordinates of Ty or the Bushpig.
In spectator or freecam mode, your position remains static while the camera moves around making it pointless
for spectators to be able to use this command.
