# Level Codes

---

There are 6 possible zones in Ty each with up to four levels. In practice, only some of these are used.

The zones are indicated by a letter. Zone 1 is marked by Z. Then, zones 2-6 are A-E respectively.

The level within the zone is indicated by a number 1-4. Therefore, Two Up which is the first level in the first zone would be A1.

This general pattern is followed for most levels but since there are exceptions, here's the full list.

| B4     | ~~Kumu Caves~~                | This level should be Crikey's Cove but due to the fourth zone being cut from the game at some point during development and the B-Zone boss being left unfinished, the finished D-Zone boss was used for the B-Zone instead. |

| D-Zone | ~~Pippy Beach~~~              | This zone was originally meant to be four levels similar to the A, B, and C-Zones. It was cut at some point in development and the levels were used for other various levels.                                               |
| D1     | Credits                       | The credits level to make the cutscenes at the end work as well as the transition on completing the doomerang section.                                                                                                      |
| D2     | Cass' Crest                   | This was originally merged with E1 (Cass' Pass) as one level called the gauntlet but was split into two late into development resulting in an extra level which ended up in the D2 level slot.                              |

| E2     | Bonus World 1                 | This was originally in the Z3 slot but was moved at some point.                                                                                                                                                             |
| E3     | Bonus World 2                 | Similarly, this was originally in the Z4 slot but was moved at some point, potentially due to the X4 levels being bosses and maybe having some code conflicts.                                                              |
