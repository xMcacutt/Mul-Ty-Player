# Spectator Mode

## What is Spectator Mode?
As the name suggests, spectator mode allows you to spectate other players in the game without disrupting them. Joining as a spectator 
forces you into freecam mode. While in this mode, you are able to move the camera freely around. It is recommended that you use controller to move the camera since it provides more speed options by holding the left shoulder button and easier height adjustment with the right shoulder and trigger buttons.

You can also force the camera to look at and stay near a specific player by cycling through them with the ctrl + shft + 9 or ctrl + shft + 0. To disengage this following mode, use the hotkey ctrl + shft + 8.

While following, you lose control over the rotation of the camera but still have access to move it freely. When the followed player jumps far away, the camera will jump close to them again.
If you switch spectatee and there are no other players in the current level, players in other levels will be searched for. If the spectatee is in a different level at any point, your level will be changed to match theirs.
