## Attributes & Rainbow Cliffs

---

Attributes describe any ability or upgrade that Ty receives during the game including swimming, diving, all of the rangs, the second life paw, and also the talismans.

Rainbow Cliffs data refers to several synced objects in Rainbow Cliffs such as the state of the thunder egg machines, the flaming logs, the E-Zone gate, and ice the sheet. 

Both of these categories are synced in the save data only. For the attributes, this causes the abilities to update instantly but the Rainbow Cliffs data does not update until after the level has been reloaded.
