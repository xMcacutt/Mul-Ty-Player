# Burner Objective

---

Burner syncing needed some extra handling so that the mission would be available for turn in by anyone even if they hadn't completed Dennis' first mission in bridge. 

A way of making the fire appear in the burner has not yet been found so when a burner is collected by another player it does not light up. 

The burner count is not displayed when someone collects a burner.
