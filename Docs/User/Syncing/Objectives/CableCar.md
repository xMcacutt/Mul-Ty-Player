# Cable Car Objective

---

Cable Car syncing is achieved using most of the same principles as koala kid syncing with a few differences

- The frills are the object and are merged in a random order with the normal frills in the level

- The frill state is written to in order to kill them manually

- The draw distance on the frills had to be turned up dramatically to allow them to die from anywhere in the level.
