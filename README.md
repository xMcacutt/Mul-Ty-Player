## Installation

Installing Mul-Ty-Player has been made EASIER THAN EVER

Manually downloading and installing the client, server, and RKV is no longer necessary.

To install Mul-Ty-Player, go to the releases page and download the "Mul-Ty-Player 1.3.0 Installer.msi".

Next, run the installer. If this is your first time using v1.3.0+, you'll want to install the RKV patcher and client.

The server application is only necessary if you wish to host sessions.

Follow the instructions in the installer. Once completed, run the RKV patcher. This may take a while.

Mul-Ty-Player should now be installed and ready to run.

#### Port Forwarding For Server Hosts.
To run the server you'll need to open port 8750 on UDP.

1. Open CMD (Command Prompt).
2. Type 'ipconfig' and press return.
3. Find IPv4 address and copy this into browser search bar.
4. Log in to your router.
5. Set up a new port forwarding rule.
6. Paste IPv4 address into forwarding address, set port to 8750, set rule to UDP.
7. READ THE ABOVE SENTENCE AGAIN AND MAKE SURE THE RULE IS UDP.
8. Go to https://www.whatismypublicip.com/ this is your public IP address.

With your port forwarding rule set up, people can now join your server using your public IP address.
