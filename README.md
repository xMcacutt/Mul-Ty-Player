## About

![Liz](/GitImages/Liz.png)

Mul-Ty-Player breathes new life into Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, allowing you to play online with your friends.

In just a few minutes, you can be exploring snowy mountains, swimming through shark infested waters, and fighting off
Boss Cass together as your favourite koalas.

## Getting Started

***If you're new to MTP, it is strongly recommended that you read the [docs](./Docs/User/User%20Guide.md). Instructions for installation are clearly defined in the first page.***

Finally, to make the whole update process for the future, a dedicated updater app
has been created using Octokit to search for updates on github and install them without
having to visit this site again.
